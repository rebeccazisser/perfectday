      <p>Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
      With your black hair and fat-ass thighs
      Street poetry is my everyday
      But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
      If I was workin at the club you would not pay
      Aiyyo, my man phife diggy, he got somthin to say</p>

      <p>I like em brown, yellow, puero rican or hatian
      Name is phife dawg from the zulu nation
      Told you in the jam that we can get down
      Now lets knock the boots like the group h-town
      You got bbd all on your bedroom wall
      But Im above the rim and this is how I ball
      A pretty little somethin on the new york street
      This is how I represent over this here beat</p>
      <p>Talkin bout you</p>

      <p>Yo, I took you out</p>
      <p>But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
      My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
      But I couldnt drop dimes cause *you couldnt relate*</p>
